                        <p>My first identifier is as a Northern Californian. There are lots of options--daughter, student, runner, friend, big sister, musician, believer, tutor, biker, employee, sweet tooth--but to me, my backdrop has always been the hills, oaks, redwoods, dry grass, windy beaches, and cold water of Northern California. I was born there. I studied the Gold Rush and coastal ecosystems grade school to high school; I explored its rich terrain on foot and on wheels; I drove the winding roads for good conversations and picnics with friends; I built forts and climbed rocks with my brothers, and practiced my trumpet to the driftwood piled in the garage; I studied scriptures outside and was one of the few members in my school; I got my first jobs to pay for gas to drive to the beach and taught math even when wildfires raked our city. It feels fitting to label myself from a place I love and I have grown in; it is the backdrop of my early biography, and its consequences play into who and how I am now. </p>
                        <p>These traits have stuck with me even as my backdrop has changed: first a year at BYU, next 18 months in Cyprus and Albania, now back in Provo. I'm still a daughter and a sister. I study much more now: Albanian language, chemistry, economics, business. I will always love being outside, and try to find opportunities to explore and share places I love with people I love. Being a friend to people is something I’ve gotten better at, and I try to reach out in my classes, ward, workplace, and even where I donate plasma. Coming back from a mission is hard. I’ve felt it, and tried to build bridges with people as I refigure out how I fit into my pre-service characteristics. Seeing God in my life is something I’ve tried to increase, as well as my wonder for the world.</p>
